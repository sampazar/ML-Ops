Using the teleporter and then taking a bus:\n- Using the teleporter will take 0 hours, so Billy will arrive at his destination at 1PM local time.\n- Taking a bus for 1 hour will bring him home at 2PM local time.\n\nSince Billy needs to be home before 7PM EDT and it is currently 1PM local time, he has enough time to take either option.

I'd want to be able to efficiently run a larger sample of prompts for each configuration and analyze the distribution of scores and then compare to how that looked for other prompts. This would give me greater confidence that a particular prompt was performing better across multiple instances of the same query.\n",
